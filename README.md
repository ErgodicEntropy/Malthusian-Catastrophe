# Malthusian-Catastrophe: Demography, Population Dynamics (Mathematical Biology) and Complex-Dynamical Systems
Simulation of Malthusian Growth Model,  Malthusian Equilibrium and Malthusian Catastrophe + Discussion on the consequences of technology and industrial revolution

## What is Malthusianism ?
"Through the animal and vegetable kingdoms, nature has scattered the seeds of life abroad with the most profuse and liberal hand. ... The germs of existence contained in this spot of earth, with ample food, and ample room to expand in, would fill millions of worlds in the course of a few thousand years. Necessity, that imperious all pervading law of nature, restrains them within the prescribed bounds. The race of plants, and the race of animals shrink under this great restrictive law. And the race of man cannot, by any efforts of reason, escape from it. Among plants and animals its effects are waste of seed, sickness, and premature death. Among mankind, misery and vice. "

— Thomas Malthus, 1798. An Essay on the Principle of Population. Chapter I.

## What is Neo-Malthusianism ?

## Human Population Planning and Control

## American Society for Eugenics, Race Science

## History: From Neolithic Demographic Transition to Columbian Exchange to Industrial Revolution

## Demography in different nations

## Zero Population movements: Between the Far-left and the Far-right: Great Replacement and Replacement level, Family Planning and Education
- Eco-Fascism and Green Nationalism: Christchurch, El paso and Buffalo Manifestos, White Skin, Black Fuel (Andreas Malm and the Zetkin Collective)
- Sterlization (Emergency program 1970s): India, Singapore...etc
